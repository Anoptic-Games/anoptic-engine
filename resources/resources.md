# Resources Directory

The `resources/` directory serves as a central repository for various built-in resources needed by the engine.


## Directory Structure

The directory structure for `resources/` might look something like this:

```
resources/
├── shaders/          # Shaders used by the engine
├── textures/         # Default or fallback textures
├── fonts/            # Fonts used by the engine
├── audio/            # Audio files, like default sound effects or music
└── scripts/          # Engine scripts, like default AI scripts or game logic
```


## Usage

The resources in this directory should be used as fallbacks or defaults when a game does not provide its own resources.

In general, game-specific resources should not be put in this directory; instead, they should be included with the game itself.
